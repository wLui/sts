This is a modification of the NIST 800-22 STS that integrates it with MPI
for HPC purposes.

Bug I fixed lol:

Changes:

Added a wrapper to the main function of sts to allow us to import data from any arbitrary memory block, specfically from MPI

All operations are done in memory, using /dev/shm/, so no disk operations are required, except for the initial input read, and final results write

Optimized so it should never use more than ~8 gb of RAM at a time on any machine.
